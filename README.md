# Cloud Foundry Firehose Exporter [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/bosh-prometheus/firehose_exporter.png)](https://travis-ci.org/bosh-prometheus/firehose_exporter)

A [Prometheus][prometheus] exporter proxy for [Cloud Foundry Firehose][firehose] metrics. Please refer to the [FAQ][faq] for general questions about this exporter.

## Architecture overview

![](https://cdn.rawgit.com/bosh-prometheus/firehose_exporter/master/architecture/architecture.svg)

## Installation

### Binaries

Download the already existing [binaries](https://github.com/bosh-prometheus/firehose_exporter/releases) for your platform:

```bash
$ ./firehose_exporter <flags>
```

### From source

Using the standard `go install` (you must have [Go][golang] already installed in your local machine):

```bash
$ go install github.com/bosh-prometheus/firehose_exporter
$ firehose_exporter <flags>
```

### Docker

To run the firehose exporter as a Docker container, run:

```bash
$ docker run -p 9186:9186 boshprometheus/firehose-exporter <flags>
```

### Cloud Foundry

The exporter can be deployed to an already existing [Cloud Foundry][cloudfoundry] environment:

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/bosh-prometheus/firehose_exporter.git
$ cd firehose_exporter
```

Modify the included [application manifest file][manifest] to include your [Cloud Foundry Firehose][firehose] properties. Then you can push the exporter to your Cloud Foundry environment:

```bash
$ cf push
```

### BOSH

This exporter can be deployed using the [Prometheus BOSH Release][prometheus-boshrelease].

## Usage

### UAA Client

In order to connect to the [Cloud Foundry Firehose][firehose] a `client-id` and `client-secret` must be provided. The `client-id` must have the `doppler.firehose` authority.

For example, to create a new `client-id` and `client-secret` with the right permissions:

```bash
uaac target https://<YOUR UAA URL> --skip-ssl-validation
uaac token client get <YOUR ADMIN CLIENT ID> -s <YOUR ADMIN CLIENT SECRET>
uaac client add prometheus-firehose \
  --name prometheus-firehose \
  --secret prometheus-client-secret \
  --authorized_grant_types client_credentials,refresh_token \
  --authorities doppler.firehose
```
